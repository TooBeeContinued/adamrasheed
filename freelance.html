        <h2>Need some help on a Project? Letâ€™s talk.</h2>
        <p>
            For the last 5 years, I've been running a small
            <a href="//creatix.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">design/development consultancy</a> where I work with small business to help them increase their revenue. Lately, I've
            been working a lot with agencies like
            <a href="https://www.epublishing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ePublishing</a> and
            <a href="https://dotdash.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dot Dash</a> to help with their projects.
        </p>

        <h2>Some Things I can help you with:</h2>
        <ul class="regular">
            <li><strong>Holy Trinity:</strong> HTML, CSS, Javascript</li>
            <li><strong>Wordpress:</strong> This includes custom themes and large-scale migration and optimization work. PHP and I have become very good friends.</li>
            <li><strong>Shopify:</strong> I started doing custom shopify themes this year, (my favorite on being <a href="/case-studies/flexrake">Flexrake</a>), and I'm in love with liquid.</li>
            <li><strong>Large-Scale CSS Architecture: </strong>Have a large project you need to make sure doesn't go awry or have an older site you need to retrofit to into a fully-responsive progressive web app that works on all devices regardless of data speed? I can help using the powers of SCSS and BEM.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Things I'm Learning:</h2>
        <ul class="regular">
            <li><strong>React:</strong> I've been dabbling in small react projects, and recently have started a portfolio piece that uses React in the frontend and hooks up to a wordpress backend through WP's REST API.</li>
            <li><strong>Progressive Web Apps (PWAs):</strong> I'm learning how important it is to make projects accessible to not only those with disabilities or impairments, but also those without access to high-speed internet or flagship phones. I'm currently learning how ot retrofit my past projects into progressive web apps.</li>

            <li><strong>ES7:</strong> Im currently learning Async Await to replace using fetch (the way I currently hook into APIs).</li>
        </ul>
