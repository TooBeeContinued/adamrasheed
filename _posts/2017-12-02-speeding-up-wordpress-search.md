## Why Wordpress Sites Slow Down as They Grow
As your website grows beyond a typical site with a handful of pages to the like of 1,000+ or even 10,000+ pages, your site will inevitably slow down due to a couple of reasons which include: a mishmash of spaghetti code that started to pile up as your code was getting fixed, and Your site having to query through thousands is not millions of lines of the databse.

## What if You have a site with 100k+ pages?
If you take on client work, you may one day get a client that has a 100k+ page wordpress site that needs to be optimized. Funny thing, that's exactly what happened to me. Now, if you have a well-coded theme and are one a good host like <a href="https://m.do.co/c/73cb4550a3de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DigitalOcean</a> (use this link and get $10 credit for free) there shouldn't be too much of a problem in the trouble happens with the search bar on your site.

With a site of this scale, wordpress literally has to query through millions of rows in your database to retrieve a specific page your user search for. Luckily, there's a fix to drastically speed up the search function on your site.

### Use Search as a Service to Host Your Data
You wouldn't want to have your cache hosted on the same server your website is on as that would substantially slow down your site (especially if you're on a shared host).
